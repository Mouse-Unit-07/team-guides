## Micromouse Handling

- Try to keep the bot in an ESD bag during transport
- Try to keep the bot clean of dust and trash
  - ...Conformal coating the components keeps the mouse clean, but you lose electrical testing capability in exchange
- Keep magnets away from IC's
  - ...Haven't limit tested this, but probably a bad idea
- Keep yourself grounded when touching/probing the bot
  - Especially during the winter when we're zapping door knobs left and right

## Battery care

- LiPo batteries demand extra care
  - Prone to fires
  - Never leave unattended when charging
  - DO NOT OVERCHARGE
  - DO NOT CHARGE IF BELOW DEAD VOlTAGE (~6.4V)
  - Store in safe pouches when charging and when not in use
